# Matching-Game
___
This is a simple matching game. I got the idea from watching my 4 year old nephew play a matching game and thinking to myself "Hey! I can totally make that using React!" Fast-forward to project 4 and we have the freedom to choose on what to make. I also (in the future) would like to do coding for a video game company. It may be a simple matching game, but I enjoyed making this game especially knowing it was going to be for my nephew.

I have made a mobile version along with a desktop version of this game.

Object of the game is to select one card (flips over, shows image, icon, etc.) then select another card. If they match they will stay turned over with the image side up, if not they will turn back around.
