# Matching-Game
___
For my project 4 I am making a simple matching game. I got the idea from watching my 4 year old nephew play a matching game and thinking to myself "Hey! I can totally make that using React!" Fast-forward to project 4 and we have the freedom to choose on what to make. I also (in the future) would like to do coding for a video game company. It maybe a simple card matching game, but I would like to make it look very clean and responsive.

I plan on having a mobile version along with a desktop version of the game.

Object of the game is to select one card (flips over, shows image, icon, etc.) then select another card. If they match they will disapear if not they will flip back around.

I plan on using:
- HTML
- CSS -- Animate.css
- JS -- React
